You can install arp-scan using:

```
brew install arp-scan
```
Please take into account that you will need to modify the path to be able to read the needed files, usually
they are located at (this is an example in case the arp-scan version is 1.9, modify it as needed):
```
$ ls /usr/local/Cellar/arp-scan/1.9/share/arp-scan/
ieee-iab.txt   ieee-oui.txt   mac-vendor.txt
```
